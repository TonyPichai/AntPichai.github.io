# A P5 collection for recursion

The npm p5-manager allows you to share libraries between sketches in a collection

### How to make a collection

1. `cd` Where you want to put your collection
2. `$ p5 new collection_name`
3. `$ cd collection_name`
4. `$ p5 g sketch_01`
   * `$ p5 generate sketch_01` - verbose


### Run The Server
1. `cd .. `
   * `cd /collection_name` simply, goto collection folder
2. `$ p5 s` to begin server
   * `$ p5 server` - verbose

The p5 manager has a nice GUI where you can access all collection files

## Alternatively - Standalone and no collection
**Method can't be used in a p5 collection folder**

Generate a sketch inside a separate folder, or the containing folder of the collection..

1. `$ p5 g -b project_name`
   * `$ p5 generate --bundle project_name` - Verbose

2. `$ http-server` - standalone http-server
   * This will link you to a server

# Recursion!

### What is recursion?
Recursion is a method of self referential generation.

We can leverage this pattern/technique/style/algorithmic process for generating organic-like systems.

We can make them with the following methods:
Function,
Object oriented,
Rule Based,
